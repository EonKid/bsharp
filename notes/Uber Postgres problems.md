After certain timeout, it kills the transaction (causing application error), and makes the update. Anyway, the replica thread is blocked for some time, which causes lagging inevitably.-	There is a bug in replication of postgres, which can cause data corruption, because changes are made on the physical layer. Mysql does replication more on a logical layer, so indexes are kept consistent-	Mysql has bad support for schema evolution – adding a new column will cause copying of all data-	Uber solved this issue by introducing “Schemaless”-	ctid – id of the row
